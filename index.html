        Hello, my name is Bryan. Welcome to my webpage. Here are a few things
        about me. I <em> love </em> pizza. I could eat pizza every day for the
        rest of my life and not get tired of it. I am extremely allergic to
        fresh abalone. When I was 14 years old, my momm bought fresh abalone to
        celebrate my birthday and I suddenly had an allergic reaction to it.
        <strong> I nearly died. </strong> My throat closed up and I was rushed
        to the hospital. Luckily, we got to the hospital before I became
        completely unable to breathe.
